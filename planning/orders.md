each player-specified order is added to a queue

every update, the unit tries to complete the order on the top of the queue

if the order has actions that must be taken first, then the unit will set its current attempted order to that prerequisite action

if all prerequisites are met, then the order itself is put into its "current order" box

the current sub-order is shown to the player but can't be changed
